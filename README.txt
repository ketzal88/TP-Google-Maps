In this project I created an interactive map using the Google Maps API with which it is able to search for an address or a place, see how to get from one place
to another and visualize the city you want with panoramic images. 
The mail goal was to concentrate on understanding the functionalities that the API provides through its documentation 
and in this way add value to a web pages with third-party services and data.
